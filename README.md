## Background
- This project was created as the final assignment for my bootcamp at CareerFoundry in 2023.
- New York City has been a fascinating city for me in many ways. Continuing my interest in developing sustainable mobility solutions, I was excited to come across this dataset.

## Data
- 5 CSV files and 1 GeoJSON file
- Survey data collected and preprocessed by a consulting company RSG
- Data source: [nyc.gov](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/citywide-mobility-survey.shtml)

The dataset comprises of the following five tables:
* Trips
* Household
* Vehicle
* People
* Day

## Context
- The New York City Department of Transportation conducted an annual travel survey named the Citywide Mobility Survey between 2017 and 2020.
- It aims to assess the travel behavior, preferences, and attitudes of New York City residents towards mobility issues.
- This case study focuses solely on the survey dataset of 2019.
- All participants are residents of New York City. 3.009 of the participants are presented in this analysis as a result of data preprocessing.
- The survey took place between May and June, 2019.

## Project Objectives
- Goal #1: Discover trends and needs by studying New Yorkers' travel behavior, such as what mode of transportation is the most popular, how much time they spend on the subway everyday.
- Goal #2: Examine two major components of this survey, namely the trip distance and the trip duration. I’ll explore the relationship and see if a linear regression model is fitting.

## Tools Used
- Anaconda / Jupyter
- Python 
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
- Excel
- Tableau
- GitHub

For fixing errors in my scripts and optimizing my visualizations, I sought assistance from ChatGPT. 

## Key Skills
- Sourcing open data for own project
- Exploratory visual analysis
- Using Python to do the following:
  - Data cleaning & wrangling
  - Creating correlation heatmap
  - Regression analysis
  - Clustering analysis
- Tableau storyboard reporting

## Notes
- This project was created as my final assignment for my Data Analytics bootcamp at [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com) in 2023.
- The data set is open source data collected by a consulting company named [Resource Systems Group, Inc.](https://rsginc.com), which was contracted by the New York City government for the CMS project. All data files were accessed on November 8th, 2023 on [nyc.gov](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/citywide-mobility-survey.shtml). The GeoJSON file for plotting the survey zones was accessed on Nov. 14th, 2023.
