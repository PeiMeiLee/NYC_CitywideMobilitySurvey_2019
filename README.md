## Notes

- The data set is open source data collected by a consulting company named [Resource Systems Group, Inc.](https://rsginc.com), which was contracted by the New York City government for the CMS project. All data files were accessed on November 8th, 2023 on [nyc.gov](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/citywide-mobility-survey.shtml). The GeoJSON file for plotting the survey zones was accessed on Nov. 14th, 2023.
