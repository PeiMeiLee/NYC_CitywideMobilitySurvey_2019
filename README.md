## Background
- This project was created as the final project for my Data Analytics bootcamp studies at [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com) in 2023.
- New York City has been a fascinating city for me in many ways. Continuing my interest in developing sustainable mobility solutions, I was excited to come across this dataset and performed my final case study on it.

## Data
- 5 CSV files and 1 GeoJSON file
- Survey data collected and preprocessed by a consulting company RSG
- Data source: [nyc.gov](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/citywide-mobility-survey.shtml)

The dataset comprises of the following five tables:
