I successfully finished this project as part of my studies in the Data Analytics Bootcamp at [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com) in 2023.
## Project Intro
The New York City Department of Transportation conducted an annual travel survey named the Citywide Mobility Survey (CMS) between 2017 and 2020.
It aims to assess the travel behavior, preferences, and attitudes of New York City residents.
This project focuses solely on the survey dataset of 2019.

###### The data is open source data collected by a consulting company named Resource Systems Group, Inc. (RSG), which was contracted by the New York City government for the CMS project.
  
## Tools
For this project, the following Python libraries were used:
* Pandas
* Numpy

For fixing errors in my scripts and optimizing my visualizations, I sought assistance from ChatGPT.
