# NYC_Citywide_Mobility_Survey_2019
I successfully finished this project as part of my studies in the Data Analytics Bootcamp at [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com) in 2023.
## Project Intro
The New York City Department of Transportation conducted an annual travel survey named the Citywide Mobility Survey (CMS) between 2017 and 2020.
It aims to assess the travel behavior, preferences, and attitudes of New York City residents.
This project focuses solely on the survey dataset of 2019.
## Data
The dataset comprises of five tables
* Trips
* Household
* Vehicle
* People
* Day
###### The data is open source data collected by a consulting company named [Resource Systems Group, Inc.](https://rsginc.com), which was contracted by the New York City government for the CMS project. All data files were accessed on November 8th, 2023 on [nyc.gov](https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/citywide-mobility-survey.shtml). The Geojson file for plotting the survey zones was accessed on Nov. 14th, 2023.
  
## Tools
